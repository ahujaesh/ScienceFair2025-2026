method = "Layer-by-layer spraying"
description = "To improve mechanical stability and maintain shape fidelity during multi-layer bioprinting, calcium chloride is applied between printed layers. This initiates partial crosslinking after each layer is deposited, reducing layer collapse and improving vertical resolution."
equipment = "Fine mist sprayer"
application_volume_per_layer = "Approximately 10 to 30 µL per cm², depending on structure"
timing = "Immediately after each layer is printed"
step_by_step =
    "1. After each layer is printed, pause the printer briefly (1 to 3 seconds)."
    "2. Lightly spray or dispense 100 mM CaCl₂ onto the surface using a sterile atomizer or precision nozzle."
    "3. Allow 10 to 30 seconds for partial crosslinking to occur before printing the next layer."
    "4. Resume printing. Repeat this process for each subsequent layer."
notes = "Avoid over-crosslinking during intermediate steps to ensure good interlayer fusion. Final full crosslinking should still be performed after printing is complete."
