The technology of extrusion-bioprinting has seen recent advances in its abilities, enabling the creation of organs and tissues from "bioinks", which are living cells, suspended in a gelatinous fluid, allowing them to be precisely formed into functional structures that can aid in the body's recovery. Since this technology is so cutting edge, the prices for a bioprinter exceed six figures for high-end multi-material printers. I have created a low-cost, entry-level bioprinter that allows for the expansion of the field and the removal of the cost barrier in the innovation and improvement of this technology. Additionally, included with this printer are features not found in many six-figure models, such as the ability for high customizability, low space footprint, and the inclusion of a custom Convolutional Neural Network that monitors the print live via an in-chamber camera. With my self-designed bioprinter, I print cell bandages, which are applied to minor cuts topically, similar to traditional bandages. Thanks to the skin cells, they promote increased wound healing by supporting the growth of new tissue, closing the cut faster than conventional bandages by X% on average. Over time, as this project and field develop, the applications increase from just simple bandages to, for example, creating large grafts for skin cancer patients or severe burn victims. By making bioprinting more accessible, this project lays the groundwork for future breakthroughs in personalized medicine and overall human health.
