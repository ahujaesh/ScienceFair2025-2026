## Notes begin:

- Droplet based bioprinting contaions two major substyles:

|Electrohydrodynamic jetting [EHDJ]|Laser-assisted bioprinting [LAB]|
|-|-|
|EHDJ uses electric currents to pull drops put of the extruder|LAB uses light to construct the droplets|

- Projection based bioprinting solidifies light sensitive materials (like 3dp resin) to build its structures

- 3D bioprinting has three steps: preparing bioinks, printing the soft live structures with multiple cells, and rebuilding the interaction among cells.

- Current 3D bioprinting techniques can be divided into two categories: orifice-based and orifice-free. In orifice-based bloprinting, nozzles with microscale orifices are used as the tools to form either cell-laden spheroids or strands as the building blocks. Inkjet bioprinting and extrusion bioprinting are two epresentative orifice-based 3D bioprinting echniques. In orifice-free bioprinting, different light sources are used as tools to form cellular yers instead of microscale orifices. Thus, the orifice-free bioprinting is also known as light based printing.

### Orifice based

- in orofice based bioprinting, the typical process consists of two main steps: printing and cross-linking. The core function of the printing step is to form building blocks at a liquid state and then deposit them based on the designed trajectories. In inkjet bioprinting, different methods are used to form cell-laden spheroids, namely droplets, as the building blocks, while in extrusion bio-printing, cell-laden filaments are generated with continuous, cylindrical morphology to construct 3D structures. The main purpose of the subsequent cross-linking step is to solidity the deposited droplets and/or filaments rapidly. Thus, the solidi-fied droplets and/or filaments cannot only keep their shapes as designed, but also have the mechanical stiffness to support the following deposited droplets and/or filaments. By repeating the printing and cross-linking steps, 3D structures can be fabricated by orifice-based bloprinting technologies. As a result, classic orifice-based bioprinting is performed in a "solidification-while-printing" fashion.

- Benifits of orofice based:

Wider range of marerials

Can have multiple orifices improving print speed

Allow for the compination of different types of cells

Chraper and more widley available

- Cons:

Higher cell damage compared to droplet based and lower shear stress resistance (aka layer line weakness)

### Orifice free

- Many subcategories:
